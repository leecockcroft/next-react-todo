This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.



## what is it?
Todo list build in react with functionality to edit and delete.
Linked up to next js and todo items saved on a json file. 

## things i learnt / to remember.

export async function DELETE(res,content) -- being unsure what to call, creating 2,3, two parameters and using thunder client to call them.
I noticed params Promise on the content call so I knew to use
 const params = await content.params; (params.params.id )

 const body = await request.json() - get the front end request.
 must return Response.json()
